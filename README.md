# CPP-CodeScreen-Fibonacci

Example CodeScreen `C++` coding assessment that requires the candidate to write a function that returns the nth element in the Fibonacci sequence.

The sequence is assumed to be 0-indexed, with `fibonacci(0)` returning 0 and `fibonacci(1)` returning 1.

The file to write this function in is [src/fibonacci.cpp](src/fibonacci.cpp).

The test cases that are run are located in [test/fibonacci_test.cpp](test/fibonacci_test.cpp).
